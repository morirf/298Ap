# Statement of purpose:

This chip will be a design for an 8-bit processor with a custom ISA. Instructions will be stored on RP2040. Chip will contain registers, ALU, and output register

# System Diagram:

PC sends address of the next instruction to RP 2040 which then sends that instruction. Control Logic decodes instruction and instructs the Datapath. Value of output register is then sent to RP2040.

# Proposed Specification

- This processor will aim to have 8 registers with the possibility to up to 20 instructions.

- An accumulator register will be used to reduce register space in the instructions.

- Will have R-type and I/J-type instructions

- MSB will be the op code

**R-Type**

| OP code \[7\] | Function\[6:3\] | Reg\[2:0\] |
|---------------|-----------------|------------|

**I/J-Type**

| OP code \[7\] | Function\[6:5\] | Immediate\[4:0\] |
|---------------|-----------------|------------------|
